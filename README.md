A simple Befunge-98 interpreter, designed according to the description
of the language found on the
[Esolang wiki article](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge) about the
language.

Befunge is a language whose source is a two-dimensional grid of characters,
where the instruction pointer refers to a location within this
two-dimensional grid. Execution maintains a stack, so the characters on
the grid can modify the stack of values as well as change the direction of
control flow on the grid.

The sample programs included in this repo are drawn directly from the
list of
[sample programs on the Esolang page](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge#Examples).
